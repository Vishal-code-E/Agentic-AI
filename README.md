🤖 Learning Agentic AI: My journey into autonomous AI systems, agent frameworks, and intelligent automation. This repo contains my notes, experiments, and projects as I explore multi-agent systems, tool-using AI, and agentic workflows.

# 🤖 Agentic AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my exploration of agentic AI systems! This repository documents my learning path through autonomous agents, multi-agent frameworks, and intelligent automation.

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- Agent architectures and design patterns
- Tool-using AI systems and function calling
- Multi-agent coordination and communication
- Agentic workflows and automation
- Popular frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, etc.)
- Real-world agent applications

## 🛠️ Projects & Experiments
- **Basic Agents**: Simple task-completing agents
- **Tool Integration**: Agents that use external APIs and tools
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Collaborative agent workflows
- **Custom Frameworks**: Building agent systems from scratch

## 📝 Learning Notes
Each folder contains detailed notes, code examples, and lessons learned from various agentic AI concepts and implementations.
